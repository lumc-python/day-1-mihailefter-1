# Exercise 3: Analyse a repeat structure
# ==========
#
# We are going to make a repeating DNA sequence and extract some subsequences
# from it.
# - Make a short tandem repeat that consists of three `ACGT` units and five
# `TTATT` units.
# - Print all suffixes of the repeat structure.
#   - **Note**: A suffix is an ending. For example, the word `spam` has five
#   suffixes: `spam`, `pam`, `am`, `m` and the empty string.
# - Print all substrings of length `3`.
# - Print all unique substrings of length `3`.
